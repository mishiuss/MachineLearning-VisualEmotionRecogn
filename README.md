## Data Visualization
Application of t-SNE with pytorch. There is used as data for visualization 68 facial landmarks, computed for each frame. 
Implemented features increasing the distance between classes computed from these landmarks. 

## Visual Feature Classification
Classification video by emotions with keypoints from landmarks and decriptors

## Audio Feature Classification
Classification of audio files by emotions with features extracted with OpenSMILE lib
